/**
 * A test for the various media information functions.
 * <p>
 * For regular media files (like ".mpg" or ".avi") the track information is available after the
 * media has been parsed (or played).
 * <p>
 * For DVD media files (like ".iso" files) the track information is not available after the media
 * has been parsed, a video output must have been created, and even then the video track
 * width/height might not be available until a short time later.
 * <p>
 * In all cases, the other functions for title, video, audio and chapter descriptions require that a
 * video output has been created before they return valid information.
 * <p>
 * For the new (LibVLC 4.0.0) track information it appears that the track information is available
 * when an elementary stream added event has been received.
